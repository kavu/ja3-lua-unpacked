I hid and listened to them talk.<newline><newline><em>The Doctor</em> plans to infect some villagers with a strange disease and scare the rest into submission, at which point the thugs will march in and easily take over the whole village to use as a base for their smuggling operation!<newline><newline>I must have uttered a gasp of surprise, for they paused and shouted into the dark. I ran all the way back to my cabin. Even as I write this, my breath catches in my throat at the memory of the terror I felt.<newline><newline>I need to hide my diary and make certain <em>Xavier</em> can find it if the worst should befall me!\"")
