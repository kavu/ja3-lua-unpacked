With all my findings, my notes, and even the feverish poetry and prose I was moved to write as I listened to the discordant chanting that seems to resound through my mind day and night - all this is preserved in my <em>diary</em>.<newline><newline>In case something happens to me, please take it and make sure to expose them to the authorities of this country. I don't trust anyone but you, so I hid the diary and left you several clues around the village which will help you find it. Look for them in the places where we talked and laughed in happier times.<newline><newline>Love,<newline><em>Roger Wilcox</em>\"")
