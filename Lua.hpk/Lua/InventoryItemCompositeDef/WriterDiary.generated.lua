I've talked to them, attended their meetings, eaten their food, drank their ceremonial beverage, and studied their primitive language. I've seen other cults in my life, but this one tests the limits of my <em>sanity</em>!<newline><newline>I wasn't surprised by their ritualistic slaughter of chickens nor by any of their many other pagan rites, but what did alarm me (nay - shook me to my very core) was the fact that I soon began to hear the call in my dreams. The call of... <em>The Old Ones</em>.<newline><newline><em>Wanda</em> has told me that those who do not listen will surely die. And then it started. People are dying! She plans to put special herbs in the water supply, so that everyone may hear the call of <em>The Old Ones</em>.\"")
