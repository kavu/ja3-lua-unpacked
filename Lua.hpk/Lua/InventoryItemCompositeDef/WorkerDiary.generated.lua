I came to <em>Landsbach</em> because I heard you could make decent money here.<newline><newline>Work in the mine is tougher than I thought it would be, so I joined this <em>Night Club</em> to blow off steam. And let me tell you something - after just one week of fighting in the ring, I made as much as I make from two months of digging in the damned mines.<newline><newline>Everybody respects me now, since I am big, have good reflexes, and win fights easily. They even started calling me <em>The Bonecrusher</em>! Yesterday, <em>Bounce</em> told me that <em>Siegfried</em> was interested in me and wants me to join his elite bodyguards. I guess I'm promoted now.\"")
